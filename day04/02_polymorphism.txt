Polymorphism in Python:

Definition:

Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms.
It allows objects of different classes to be treated as the same type.

Requirements:
The inheritance relationship between those different classes is required.

Implementation:
Polymorphism is often achieved through method overriding, where a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already provided by its superclass.

Example:
If you have a base class Shape and subclasses like Circle and Rectangle, you can treat both Circle and Rectangle objects as Shape objects.


                class Shape:
                    def draw(self):
                        # Common implementation for all shapes

                class Circle(Shape):
                    def draw(self):
                        # Specific implementation for circles

                class Rectangle(Shape):
                    def draw(self):
                        # Specific implementation for rectangles


Usage of Polymorphism:

Method Parameters:
You can use polymorphism in method parameters.
For example, if a method takes a Shape parameter, it can accept any object that is a subclass of Shape.


                def draw_shape(shape):
                    shape.draw()  # Calls the appropriate draw method based on the actual type of the object (polymorphism).


Common Methods and Variables:
Polymorphism allows you to use common methods and variables of all the different shape objects.


                circle = Circle()
                rectangle = Rectangle()

                circle.draw()    # Calls the draw method of Circle
                rectangle.draw()  # Calls the draw method of Rectangle



Exception Handling in Python:

You've also mentioned exception handling in Python, which is crucial for dealing with unexpected events. Here's a brief summary:

try & except:
    Used to handle exceptions.
    try block contains statements that might cause an exception.
    except block contains statements to handle the exception.

                try:
                    # try block statements
                except ExceptionType:
                    # except block statements

else:
An optional block that gets executed if no exception occurs in the try block.


                try:
                    # try block statements
                except ExceptionType:
                    # except block statements
                else:
                    # else block statements


finally:
An optional block that always gets executed after try & except blocks, whether an exception occurs or not.


                try:
                    # try block statements
                except ExceptionType:
                    # except block statements
                else:
                    # else block statements
                finally:
                    # finally block statements



Raise an Exception:
You can manually throw an exception using the raise keyword.

                if something_went_wrong:
                    raise SomeException("Something went wrong")
