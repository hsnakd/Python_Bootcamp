# TODO Why Learn Python?

    • The most popular programming language
    • The easiest programming language
    • The demand is high
    • Extremely versatile

# TODO Python software includes the following components:

    • Interpreter       (Runs Python code)
    • Support Library   (Built-in modules, functions, constants, types, exceptions, data types, file formats, etc.)

    ** Python - Interpreter    : An interpreter is a program reading the source code line by line, translates them to machine code in runtime.
    ** Java - Compiler         : A compiler is a tool that translates the entire source code of a program into a form that can be executed by the computer’s hardware


# TODO First Python Programming

    • IDE: Integrated Development Environment for Python
    • Project: The root directory of all our python files and packages
    • Py: python file is where we write our source codes
    • Py-Pkgs: Collection of modules. Modules that are related to each other


# TODO: Common Escape Sequences

    Escape Sequence     Name                    Description
    \n                  Newline                 Advances the cursor to the next line for subsequent printing
    \t                  Horizontal Tab          Causes the cursor to skip over to the next tab stop
    \\                  Backslash               Causes a backslash to be printed
    \"                  Double quote            Causes a double quotation mark to be printed
    \’                  Single quote            Causes a single quotation mark to be printed
